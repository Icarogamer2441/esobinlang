# esobinlang
an esolang called esobin which is like brainf**k but is binary

## about
This esoteric language was created inspired by brainf**k and it has a very simple and functional interpreter, create codes that print messages using a binary code style code (1 and 0), use the number 2 to print letters, 3 for comments and 4 for repetitions. If you just put a 1, it will increment 1 in the number 1 position and if you put 0 it will do the same thing but for the 0 position. Now that you've learned this, you can look at the language code and see how many times you have to put 1 and 0 to print a letter or symbols, spaces and new lines. Ex: 1002: prints the letter 'a' in the output but without a new line.

## playground
